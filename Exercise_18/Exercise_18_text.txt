This week, we'll experiment with threads. Here's the basic idea: I want to count all of the words in all of the files that match a particular pattern. (We'll use "glob.glob" to retrieve the files matching that pattern.)

The idea is that I can invoke the function
    count_words('/foo/bar/*.txt')

and all of the words (i.e., strings separated by one or more whitespace characters) will be counted.

I want you to implement this twice:
count_words goes through each of the matching files sequentially
count_words opens a thread for each of the files.

In order to implement the second version of count_words, you might need to learn a bit about how threading works in Python.  In particular, you'll want to use the "threading" library (and the "Thread" class within it), including the "start" and "join" methods.  You'll also probably want to use a "Queue" (in the "queue" module) to synchronize the information you've found so far.

Question or comments?  Go to the forum!

I'll be back on Monday with solutions.
